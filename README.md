A simple app to calculate wake up times using MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS to host the backend code. Enter your bedtime and it factors in the 15 minutes it takes to sleep to calculate your optimal wake up times.

React code is in ./client
Express code is in ./server

To run just the React frontend without the server, cd into client and npm run start (or just npm start).
To run just the backend with the current deployment build, cd into server and npm run start (or just npm start).

To run both concurrently, cd to root and npm run start (or just npm start).
